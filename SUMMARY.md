**Powerline Detection** is a dataset for object detection tasks. It is used in the energy industry.

The dataset consists of 90 images with 160 labeled objects belonging to 1 single class (*powerline*).

Each image in the Powerline Detection dataset has bounding box annotations. There is 1 unlabled image (i.e. without annotations). There are 3 splits in the dataset: *test* (7 images), *valid* (3 images), and *train* (80 images). The dataset was released in 2022 by the [Roboflow community](https://universe.roboflow.com/college-2t4kc).

Here is the visualized example grid with annotations:
